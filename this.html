        <h1>Web pages assignment</h1>
        <p>This was a final project for our web development 101 course,
        so I made this slightly self-referencing set of pages to show
        my learning. Don't try the project links, they don't go anywhere yet.</p>
        <h2>Pages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/index.html">There's the typical index page with some background flair</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about.html">About page for a description of me</a></li>
            <li><a href="/portfolio.htm">Portfolio page for showing this document</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jylant" target="_blank">Finally, I have a link to my GitHub profile page opening in a tab</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are also accessible down below on this page.</p>
        <h2>Styling</h2>
        <p>I tried to have a uniform look for these pages while varying it
        to keep it feeling fresh.</p>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This was somewhat obscure as a scoring point for me, so I just made some functionalities. Some inline, others in their own file.
        Don't mind the icosahedron stellation, it'll go off-screen if the browser is stretched to screen length</p>
        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Jylant/ProjectSite">Github link for code inspection.</a></p>
